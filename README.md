# !!! CIRCLIB IS CURRENTLY BROKEN. MOST TOOLS WILL NOT WORK !!!

Experimental tools for CircloO. Works with CircloO level files. Be sure to backup your levels, **I am not responsible for any data loss or corruption.**

To start using the tools:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install circlib: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

Each tool is separated into its own package, and they have their own markdown files documenting the usage.
